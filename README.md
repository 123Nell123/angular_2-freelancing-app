# angular_2-freelancing-app
MEAN stack web application for searching and hiring freelancers

Users can publish both public jobs, for freelancers to list their price, and private jobs, where one freelancer receives the job offer and then accepts it or denies it. Users also rate each other based on satisfaction about contractor's work and effort. Users can also edit their profile page and buy more coins. 

- Install node_modules with npm install inside project-app folder
- Run the web application by running: npm start

- Node.js API is not posted. API was made by me and two colleagues as a project.
